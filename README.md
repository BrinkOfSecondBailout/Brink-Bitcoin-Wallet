# Brink Bitcoin Wallet

I've been a bitcoiner since mid-2017. It was partially because of bitcoin that I decided to learn how to code. This is my first project involving bitcoin. Built by Python/Django. This is an experimental, fun application where users can sign up, login, and have a HOT wallet created for them. They can then use this wallet to send and receive bitcoin, as well as check the entire history of their wallet's transactions. More features being added soon.
